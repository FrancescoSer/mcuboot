This is MCUboot version 1.8.0

MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. The goal of MCUboot is to
define a common infrastructure for the bootloader, system flash layout on
microcontroller systems, and to provide a secure bootloader that enables
simple software upgrades.

MCUboot is operating-system and hardware independent, and relies on
hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with. Currently,
MCUboot works with the following operating systems:
- [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)
- [Apache Mynewt](https://mynewt.apache.org/)
- [Apache NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/)
- [RIOT](https://www.riot-os.org/)
- [Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/)
- [Espressif IDF](https://idf.espressif.com/)

RIOT is supported only as a boot target. We will accept any new
port contributed by the community once it is good enough.

## Using MCUboot

Instructions for different operating systems can be found below:
- [Zephyr](docs/readme-zephyr.md)
- [Apache Mynewt](docs/readme-mynewt.md)
- [Apache NuttX](docs/readme-nuttx.md)
- [RIOT](docs/readme-riot.md)
- [Mbed OS](docs/readme-mbed.md)
- [Espressif IDF](docs/readme-espressif.md)

There are also instructions for the [Simulator](sim/README.rst).

## Roadmap

The issues being planned and worked on are tracked using GitHub issues. To
