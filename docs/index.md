# MCUboot

MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs.

## Overview

The goal of MCUboot is to define a common infrastructure for the bootloader,
system flash layout on microcontroller systems, and to provide a secure
bootloader that enables easy software upgrade.

MCUboot is operating-system and hardware independent, and relies on
hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with. Currently
MCUboot works with the following operating systems:
- [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)
- [Apache Mynewt](https://mynewt.apache.org/)
- [Apache NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/)
- [RIOT](https://www.riot-os.org/)
- [Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/)
- [Espressif IDF](readme-espressif.md)

RIOT is supported only as a boot target. We will accept any new port
contributed by the community once it is good enough.

MCUboot is an open governance project. See the [membership
list](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/wiki/Members) for current
members, and the
[project charter](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/wiki/MCUboot-Project-Charter)
for more details.
